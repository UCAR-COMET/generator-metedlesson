      '1': 'As sea levels rise and the frequency of coastal flooding increases, the need to forecast and plan for these events is growing. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) <a href=https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/high-tide-flooding/monthly-outlook.html>Monthly High Tide Flooding Outlook</a> shows users where and when high tide flooding (HTF) is likely in the coming months. By integrating the Outlook into regular use, coastal communities can better prepare and respond to potential flooding days, reducing negative impacts from high tide flooding and sea-level rise.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn this lesson, you will use the Monthly Outlook to work through a short-term planning scenario where you plan an operational agenda. Through this, you will gain an understanding of the Monthly Outlooks capabilities, learn how to interpret the projections it provides, and how to use it in a realistic situation.',

Al integrar el Pronóstico mensual en el uso habitual, las comunidades costeras pueden prepararse y responder mejor a los posibles días de inundaciones, reduciendo los impactos negativos de las inundaciones por mareas altas y el aumento del nivel del mar.\r\n<br><br>\r\nEn esta lección, usted utilizará el Pronóstico mensual para trabajar en un escenario de planificación a corto plazo en el que planificará una agenda operativa. De este modo, comprenderá las capacidades del Pronóstico mensual, aprenderá a interpretar las proyecciones que brinda y a utilizarlas en una situación realista.',
